# SQUID3 CONFIG

It is for people that mass create proxy when server have multiple IP assigned.
You copy output to /etc/squid3/squid.conf
Creates acl to paste into squid3 config file 



It has 3 different scripts for you to choose 
ipinput.py You input ip into cmd and it saves to txt file.
ipalltxt.py It takes ip from ip.txt file and saves to acl.list.txt.
ipallcmd.py It takes ip from ip.txt and prints it in terminal.

I recommend to use it in Virtual Environment.


Thanks

# SQUID3 CONFIG

It is for people that want to mass create proxy when server have multiple IP assigned.
You copy output to "/etc/squid3/squid.conf"
Bot creates "acl" to paste into squid3 config file.



It has 3 different scripts for you to choose 

ipinput.py You input IP into cmd and it saves it to txt file.

ipalltxt.py It copy IP's from ip.txt file and save it to acl.list.txt.

ipallcmd.py Script copy IP from ip.txt and prints it in terminal.

I recommend to use it in Virtual Environment.


Thanks
